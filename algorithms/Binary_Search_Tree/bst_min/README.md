# Finding minimum in a Binary_Search_Tree

Binary Search Tree as the name suggests is a tree data structure that is used to maintain the data in a sorted order.
Binary here refers to the fact that each node has maximum two children,also taking into consideration that the left child is always smaller
than the parent node and the right child is bigger than the parent node.
This program traverses the tree and finds the minimum value.

### Input Format

We need to enter the number of nodes we want in the tree and enter data for each node of the tree

### Output Format

The minimum value found is displayed

Enter data: 7

Enter data: 8

Enter data: 3
