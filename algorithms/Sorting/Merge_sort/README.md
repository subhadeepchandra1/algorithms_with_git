# Merge Sort

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves.The **merge()** function is used for merging two halves

### Input Format
- The input consists of two lines.
- In the first line, there will be a single integer **N**.
- In the second line, there will be **N** space separated integers.

### Output Format

- There will be **N** space separated integers sorted in increasing order.

### Sample Input

```
8
98 45 34 12 56 67 89 1
```

### Sample Output

```
1 12 34 45 56 67 89 98
```

### Implemented in:

- [C](Merge_Sort.c)





 Python Implementation:

 ## Input Format

The input consists of one lines-
 * Line contains space separated integers which are required to be sorted

 ## Output Format

 Space separated integers sorted in non-decreasing order

 ## Sample Input

 ```
 5 2 4 3 1
 ``` 
 ## Sample Output

 ```
 1 2 3 4 5
 ```

 ## Implemented in:

 * [Python](merge_sort.py)
